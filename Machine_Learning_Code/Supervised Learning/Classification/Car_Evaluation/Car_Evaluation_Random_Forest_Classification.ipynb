Relevant Information Paragraph:\n","\n","   Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical\n","   decision model originally developed for the demonstration of DEX\n","   (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision\n","   making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates\n","   cars according to the following concept structure:\n","\n","   CAR                      car acceptability\n","   . PRICE                  overall price\n","   . . buying               buying price\n","   . . maint                price of the maintenance\n","   .

Besides the target\n","   concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts:\n","   PRICE, TECH, COMFORT. Every concept is in the original model\n","   related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for\n","   these examples sets see http://www-ai.ijs.si/BlazZupan/car.html).\n","\n","   The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural\n","   information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input\n","   attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.\n","\n","   Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be\n","   particularly useful for testing constructive induction and\n","   structure discovery methods.\n","\n","5.
